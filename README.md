# üëã Welcome to _Immersive Incantations_!
This is a new and somewhat ambitious project of mine which has been brewing for some time, but marks my first steps back into the world of video game modding and the Java programming language.

Unless I somehow rope other people into working on this with me, this is very much a solo project and will likely remain that way. Expect updates to be slow and erratic, art to be... scuffed at best, and my vision for the project to change constantly.

Hopefully once I've gotten the ball rolling that momentum should carry us far.

## What will Immersive Incantations be?
That's both a very easy and very difficult question to answer. At the moment I have a clear vision for what I want, but that hasn't crystalised into any details to share just yet. Part of the fun of this project will be exploring and discovering exactly what this turns into, but I'll try to explain what I'm going for below:

This mod lifts a lot of heavy inspiration from Emoniph's Witchery mod for 1.7.10, and will likely wind up being a substitute for Bewitchment, Enchanted: Witchcraft, Hexerei, and its other spiritual successors in modern versions. That's not to say it'll wind up playing the same as any of them, but it'll have a similar vibe and will aim to achieve the same kind of things those mods do.

Keeping with the Minecraft inspirations, I've been enjoying how the [Let's Do] series of culinary mods and even Mojang's official updates are presented, themed, and modularised. Depending on how big this project gets, you might find that Immersive Incantations becomes a pick-and-mix bag of smaller scoped pieces with very specific goals and intentions.

The other big inspiration, as I've mentioned in the description, is real-world esotericism, the occult, shamanism, and other spiritual or magical modes of thought. If you're at all familiar with that sort of thing, you might see the ideas echoed or manifest in this mod. Expect altars; a recurring theme of wands, cups, coins, and swords; rites and rituals; and a healthy handful of spirits.

And of course, there will be some inspirations lifted from pop culture too. You might meet some frosty undead counts with a very peculiar dress code...

Naturally, I'd love to unify all of these in the lovely üïØÔ∏èWitchcoreüïØÔ∏è aesthetic. Provided my artistic skills hold up, I'd like to grace your worlds with cosy crooked cottages filled with homely plants, cute animal companions, cauldrons, potion shelves, ovens, and much, much more.

## How can I help?
First of all, thanks for wanting to contribute!

If you'd like to help out, you can create an issue, discussion, or pull requests for new features, suggestions, bug fixes, and more.

This will be the first public and open-source project I'll have worked on, let alone hosted, so there will be a lot of learning involved and mistakes will be made, but I'll refrain from putting up any boundaries right now and I'm pretty much open to any kind of feedback or engagement until the need for any specific processes arise.

All you need to do is get in touch <3
